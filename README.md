Hello there! My name is Tony and I'm a master student in Statistics at the Humboldt-University Berlin and a passionate statistic nerd. 
My interest span all kinds of topics for example statistical learning, econometrics, or high-dimensional statistics. More projects can be found on my <a href = "https://amor.cms.hu-berlin.de/~gotschat/main.html"> website. </a>
I am currently writing my master thesis about <a href="https://arxiv.org/search/?query=benign+overfitting&searchtype=all&source=header"> benign overfitting </a>
with Dr. Martin Wahl and Prof. Markus Reiß as my supervisors.
